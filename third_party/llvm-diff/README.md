This directory contains source codes for llvm-diff. Initial code,
Diff*.cpp, came from llvm project. Git tag for the imported code is
"llvmorg-13-init". The latest source code for the llvm project is avaiable
at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project. Please note that the llvm-diff
here will be adapted to work for kernel livepatch generation. Hence it's
diverged from the upstream llvm-diff.
