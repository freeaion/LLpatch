This directory contains template files used to generate kernel
livepatch. There are three files under this directory.

1) livepatch.c.tmpl
   - livepatch wrapper linked to klp_patch.o file that contains
     implementation of livepatched functions.

2) livepatch.lds.tmpl
   - linker script that resolves address for the livepatced function.

3) Makefile.tmpl
   - makefile to build kernel livepatch.

Each template contains {{MARKER}} in it hoping that they are replaced by
either `llpatch` or `livepatch gen` command.
